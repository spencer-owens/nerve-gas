In December 2023, I set out to help an expanding regional business, Maverik, better predict the revenue of its new store locations.

Business Problem:
As Maverik expands, it opens new stores and it would like to be able to predict, with some certainty, how much revenue a new store will generate in its first year.

Objective:
I will be building predictive models to estimate the revenue for new locations in their first year. I will measure success with RMSE and, specifically, by comparing that to benchmarks.

Benefit:
Armed with this data Maverik will be able to better allocate resources and make better decisions around opening new stores.

Difficulties:
The primary challenge in this engagement was the RMSE. Typically, one would separate the training and testing data randomly to avoid introducing bias. However, because of the benchmarks provided by Maverik, it became necessary to devise a new way to divide the data and measure RMSE.

The discussion is a little sparse in the notebook, but the videos help elucidate the techniques used. The two parts of the video presentation can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NssDFJ58Z0SlmIgYicfny5AbBVVYj6rG/view?usp=drive_link"> here</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y_jSg4JzeRBu3ZyQ9f_GHVTFA_okYRGN/view?usp=drive_link"> here </a>. :clapper: :slightly_smiling_face:

Conclusion:
From this project the main thing I learned was how to apply theoretical knowledge to real (messy) data and how to deal with real stakeholders. It was time well spent.
